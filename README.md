# Two-Stage-Robust-Optimization
Two stage robust optimization using a column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;CG) method.
This is an example code for the classical C&CG algorithm for two stage robust optimization, which is programmed by original Python Gurobi solver.

for more details.

All the constrains were transformed into Matrix formulations.
